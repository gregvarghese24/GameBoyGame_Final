# GameBoyGame_Final
Created a GameBoy game, which was inspired by Super Mario Bros. 3. The game is titled 'The Adventures of Keeping Up'. It has three levels and a map home page where the player can access the next level earned. All background and sprint artwork was created by me using Usenti pixel art. Music was not created by me and I do not own the music.
